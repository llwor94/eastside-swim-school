Lisa is phenomenal!

I have 4 kids and we’ve been taking swim lessons from Lisa for a little over a year now, and I’m so glad we found her! Ever since we switched and started weekly semi-private lessons with Lisa, I can see a huge improvement with my older boys. She has taught them proper technique  and the nuances of swimming that most instructors aren’t able to teach. At this point, they would probably be able to compete fairly well in a swim team setting if they chose to pursue that.

My two younger ones, a 5 and 3 year old have learned in a year what probably took my older boys 2 years to learn. And the 3 year old is learning more about being comfortable in the water and being able to swim to an edge if he ever fell in. Lisa has helped him be extremely comfortable in an aquatic setting and is helping him learn basic safety.

With something like swim lessons, you do get what you pay for. And I want my kids to be comfortable in the water, be able to survive if they need to, and I’m confident that my kids will be able to do that, especially with Lisa’s help.
