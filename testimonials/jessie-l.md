I joined the Masters swim program at Gold Creek Gym in Woodinville (not Gold's Gym, mind you - goldcreektennis.com) a few year's ago and it's the best thing I've done in a long time! Not having a swimming background, I didn't know what I didn't know! Under Lisa's tutelage, I can now do butterfly and backstroke which I had never done before joining. She's really good at teaching the technical aspects of a stroke, so as a result, I keep improving my freestyle times which is very inspiring. Even though some nights I'm exhausted at 8 pm to start practice, I ALWAYS feel better at the end of my workout. Lisa works us really hard, but she's also really good at bringing on new people and working with a variety of different skill sets. 

Lisa serves as my swim coach, but she also spent some time giving swim lessons to my 11 year old son. She did a really nice job explaining things so that they made sense to him and was great at motivating him to try new things (always a challenge). I trust Lisa as a coach for all swim related activities (indoor, outdoor etc..) plus biking, running and anything else athletic.
