Lisa is an amazing coach and swim teacher. About 2 years ago she started giving private swim lessons to my then 13-year old son who could swim but had zero technique. He is autistic and she was so calm and patient with him. After about a year he decided that he wanted to try swim team at the high school. So she spent about 9 months (weekly lessons) working with him on all the different strokes that he was expected to know for swimming. He did do swim team at the high school and we can thank Lisa for instilling him with confidence. She was just great for him and easy for me to work with as well. I highly recommend Lisa for swim lessons.
