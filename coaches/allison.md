Growing up in California Allison was always in the water. She started competitive swimming when she was 5 and hasn’t stopped. Getting an athletic scholarship to swim at SDSU she swam throughout college and dove right into masters swimming once her college days were over. 

Allison started teaching swim lessons when she was 14 in her parents backyard and has loved being able to teach such an important life skill! Coaching all different levels of competitive swimming, she loves teaching the ones who are new or unfamiliar to the water and watching them grow in the pool and as a swimmer. “My goal is to get you or your little one water safe and comfortable in and around water while having fun! Nobody should be afraid of the pool.”
