My name is Travis, and I love everything about swimming.  I grew up outside Pittsburgh and went to Penn State.  I started swimming at 8 years-old.  I swam competitively up through my Freshman year in college.  In my 20s and 30s, I have competed in multiple triathlons and completed an Ironman 70.3.  I believe everyone should learn how to swim and respect the water.  Swimming opens up a lot of fun activities and is an amazing way to exercise.  My grandmother swam into her 90s, and she was always happy and active.  I attribute her great attitude and health to swimming ;-)

When my family and I moved out here almost 8 years ago, I wanted to share my love for and learnings about swimming, so I became an assistant coach for the Woodinville HS Boys team for two years and head coach of the Kingsgate Gator for a summer until our son was born.  I love seeing swimmers' reactions when they experience the results of their hard work, from overcoming their fear of the water to hitting their goal time in a race.  I look forward to helping you and your family enjoy swimming and feeling comfortable in the water.
