I grew up in Bellevue and from a very young age was drawn to the water! I started swim team when I was 5 years old and competed for 13 years. I have taught swim lessons on and off for about 12 years ranging from 12 months to adults. I stepped away from teaching lessons so I could focus on coaching swimmers at a competitive level. I coached at Newport High School for 8 years but recently got the urge to get back into swim lessons!  I have experience with teaching competitive swimmers to fearful beginners. Swimming has brought me so much joy in my life and my hope is to help others share this joy as well! I have a strong passion for water safety and take great pride in joining a team of instructors that hold water safety to such a high standard.
