Born in Hawaii, Carrie’s love for the water started very early. At age 5, she started competitive swimming and continued all through her childhood. Carrie began teaching swim lessons at age 15, at both private and public pools, and continued to teach swimming through college. 

Her passion for the water continued into her career, getting a Master of Marine Biology, followed by work at NOAA, The Nature Conservatory, and the University of Washington. 

In addition to teaching swim, Carrie currently runs her own business, Fiddlehead Creations, who’s aim is to inspire and promote nature conservation.
