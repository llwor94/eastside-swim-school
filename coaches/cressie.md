Water has always been an integral part of Cressie's life.  She swam competitively for years, and more recently enjoys competing in triathlons.  She taught swim lessons for over ten years; throughout her high school, college, and her early teaching years.  She then began her career as an elementary school teacher.  She has taught for twelve years in the Edmonds School District in first grade, third grade, fourth grade, and special education. Cressie and her family (husband and two daughters) love being active and going on adventures. 

Teaching swim lessons allows her to combine her passion for education with her love of the water. She loves helping children and adults gain confidence in the water and strengthen their skills and techniques.
