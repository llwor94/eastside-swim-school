Hey, Iâ€™m Ava! I have been working at Eastside Swim School for a year now. When I was younger, I learned how to swim at this same pool! I love to see kids progress their swim skills; helping kids be safe and have fun! Coming from a family of swimmers I grew up loving the water and swimming competitively and have been competing ever since. Swimming is my passion and I want to help kids not only learn how to swim and be safe around water, but also to love it as much as I do.
