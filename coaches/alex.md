Alex was swimming before he could walk.  He grew up learning from his mom (Lisa the owner of this swim school).  Alex competed in summer swim teams as a child.  He played football, basketball and continued with baseball as his main sport into his college years.  Alex is great with kids.  Alex just graduated from Biola University.  Proud mom is excited to have Alex joining the staff teaching this summer.
