Being in the water was year round for me as I was born and raised in Southern California.  I grew up with a pool in my back yard and the beach just a short drive away, so swimming filled many of my days.  I took up the sport of Triathlon in college which led to a love of cycling and all things outdoors.  I have been blessed to be a stay at home mom for the past 19 years, raising up our two children.  I love working with children and young adults and look forward to teaching your children!
