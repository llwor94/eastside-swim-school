I am a married mother of two teenage boys, and in my spare time I volunteer at Paws Wildlife as a rehabber.  I am a member of WASART animal rescue team and help with ASPCA field investigation rescue team.   My love for the water and swimming started at an early age, Growing up in Southern California provided me the opportunity to learn and compete with some of the best SoCal swimmers.

  That same passion that drove me to be an extremely accomplished swimmer has been transformed into my love for teaching children.  With my 25 years of teaching I have learned to make it fun and to teach your kids life saving skills.   Like anything the more you practice the more familiar swimming will become. My goal is to ensure everyone knows how to swim and be safe around the water.
