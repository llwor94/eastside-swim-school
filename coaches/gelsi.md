I have been in the water since I was 6 months old and took swim lessons through out my childhood. I swam competitively in high school and have over 15 years of lifeguard and swim instructor experience.

My goals as a swim instructor are to give my students the skills to be safe in the water so that they can love swimming as much as I do.
