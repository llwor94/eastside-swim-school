Hi my name is Hannah Gangwish. I am going into my Junior year at Woodinville High School. I have been a lifeguard for about 3 years. My swimming career began early in my life, I started to learn how to swim at just 6 months old. I loved it and continued swimming. At the age of 5, I joined my first competitive swim team and have been swimming on one ever since. I love to work and teach kids, and in my free time I enjoy being creative with art and cooking
