Hi, my name is Hannah. I have been working at Eastside Swim School for three years. My swimming career began early in my life. I began to learn how to swim at just 6 months old and at the age of 5, I joined my first competitive swim team and have been swimming competitively ever since. I love to teach kids, and in my free time I enjoy being creative with art and cooking.
