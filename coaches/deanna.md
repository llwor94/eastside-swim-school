My cute mother decided I needed a job when I was just 14 years old. So, she set up my first swimming class. It has been a water journey since then. During the past 40 years I have taught over 20,00 children how to swim, coached USS Swim teams, coached Recreational Swim Teams, coaches Master Swim teams, taught Water Aerobics, Trained Lifeguards and Coached Water Polo. I have managed several Olympic size pools and facilities. Pools and swimming is my second love behind my family.

I absolutely love teaching or coaching all levels of swimming. I enjoy teaching the swimmer who is just learning water adjustments or coaching elite swimmers. I have been called the “child whisperer” for my ability to calm down the young frightened swimmer. I enjoy competing and swimming with aMaster Swim team and cin 1/2 Ironman triathlons. I also enjoy cycling, basketball and riding motorcycles.
