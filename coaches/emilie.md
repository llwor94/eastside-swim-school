Hi, my name is Emilie! My swimming journey began in Yakima, WA where I grew up in the pool through lessons and the local YMCA and high school swim teams.  After high school, I accepted an athletic scholarship and swam four years at San Diego State University.
Throughout high school and college, I worked as a swim instructor for children eight-months through 18-years-old in group, semi-private and private teaching environments.  Not ready to step away from the pool following my collegiate swimming career, I began coaching at Seattle University where I stayed for one season before pursuing my Masterâ€™s Degree and other career path working with children in the hospital setting.  I love being able to share my love and passion for the water with those learning to blow bubbles for the first time all the way to those who are looking to refine their stroke technique.
