Hi! My name is Ariel. I'm passionate about swimming and happy to share my love of being in the water with you.
I learned to swim before I could walk. By the time I was 11 I was swimming the Kona Ironman course and scuba diving. Currently I am an ironman triathlete, having trained and competed locally and internationally.  
My teaching career began at 19 when I began teaching self defense, including opening my own school in Bellevue. However, I missed the triathlon and swimming community.  When I was offered a chance to coach at YMCA I jumped at the opportunity.  
Lisa and I met through this amazing community and I was excited by the "eastside standard". I am proud to represent a school that prides itself on providing quality education and demanding high standards from its instructors. Having worked with students from preschool to adult, I am both qualified and excited to work with you.
