I have been swimming before I could walk, and did synchronized swimming growing up as well. I love being close to the water and plan to be around the water for the rest of my life. I have been working at Eastside Swim for about a year and love watching kids grow as swimmers. I really care about teaching kids the importance of water safety and helping them feel comfortable in the water. I love teaching and am excited to teach your kids!
