## Lesson Schedule

Swim lessons are once a week for thirty minutes.

## Ages

Adult or child, if you’re older than 6 months we can improve your swimming. For children we offer a Water Babies program in which parents are involved. For senior-citizens we offer a ramped entry and comfortable water temperature. For everyone in between, our advanced instructors can up your game.

## Prices

**Group:**

Classes average $25 a class or $100 a month.

**One instructor, one student:**

These vary by instructor and range from $45 - $50 per class.

**One instructor, two students:**

These are for siblings or friends and are $35 per student. We do not arrange the pairings.

**Willows Prep Student Discount**

Our host facility provides its students a 15% discount on all classes.

**Registration/Member Fee**

There is no registration or monthly membership fee at Eastside Swim School.

## Makeup Policy

We cannot provide credit for missed classes.

## Cancellation Policy

We require AT LEAST 24 hours notice of cancellation which allows us time to try to fill the spot.   If a lesson is cancelled within the 24 hours, we will try to fill the spot but if we can't your account will be charged for the lesson.

## Assigned Instructors

We do our best to keep your child with the instructor they’ve become comfortable with but we must reserve the prerogative to use a substitute teacher on an occasional basis.

## Discontinued Lessons

If you wish to discontinue lessons for the following month, for any reason, notice is required at least 10 days before the end of the month. This means that if you wish to stop swim lessons in May notice is required before April 20th. All suspensions will begin on the first day of the following month. There are no mid-month suspensions.
