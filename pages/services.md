## Lessons

Eastside Swim School specializes in private classes of one or two students at a time. We feel that the best way to develop sound swimming technique for anything from basic safety to triathlon-level competition, from toddler to senior-citizen, is to have the devoted attention of a qualified professional. We offer larger classes of three to four students as needed. Our instructors have decades of teaching experience and are proud parents themselves.

## Adult Learn To Swim

It’s never too late to learn to swim. Eastside Swim School offers instruction to adults who have little to no in-water experience as well as adults who simply want to improve. Whether you want to simply learn to keep your head above the water or brush up on your breaststroke our instructors will help you achieve your goals.

## Pre-Competition Swim Team

Eastside Swim School offers beginner swimmers the opportunity to get prepared for more advanced swim teams. We coach pre-comp swimmers in all 4 swimming strokes as well as flip turns and other swim team basics. We offer both a beginner level and a more advanced level for those swimmers that may be seeking additional personal help with their technique.

## Advanced Swim Technique and Triathlon Classes

Eastside Swim School features instructors who are certified and trained in Triathlon Coaching and advanced swimming techniques. Using high resolution underwater cameras we can break down a swimmer’s stroke in granular detail to achieve peak speed and efficiency.

## Seniors and Disabled
